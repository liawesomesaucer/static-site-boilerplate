# A static site boilerplate
A boilerplate for static site. Includes SASS and hot-reload (html & sass/css) through browserSync

## Setup
Run `npm install` to get all dependencies for this boilerplate

## How to build
Since this is static, we must compile the SASS and hot reload, so run this:

```
gulp
```

BrowserSync should open a tab for you but if it doesn't, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
